# 1. Project Overview 

Courier Crusader is a top down rogue like game built in Unity where the player has to balance delivering packages or stealing them in order to pay their rent at the end of the day. The player also has to balance other factors such as endurance, theft level, in order for the game to continue. They also have a talent tree which they can spec out their character during each run to customize the player experience.

## 1.2 Project Description 




## 1.3 Conceptualizations and Motivations

Many top down rogue lites have a similar concept of a player trying to survive in a procedurally generated world. Courier Crusader is no different, but it has a few unique features that make it stand out from the rest. The first is the ability to steal packages from people within the world. This adds a new layer of strategy to the game as the player has to balance the risk of stealing packages with the reward of getting more money. The second is the talent tree. The talent tree allows the player to customize their character to their play style. This allows the player to have a unique experience every time they play the game. The third is the ability to upgrade your character. The player can upgrade their character by buying new items which will increase their stats. This allows the player to have a sense of progression as they play the game.


## 1.4 Player Experience 
# 2 Findings 
## 2.1 Project Scope
### 2.1.1 Project Constrains 
### 2.1.2 Technology Involved 

- Game Engine Choice: Unity 

  - The Unity game engine provides all the tools for a top down 2D game along with providing us the ability to deploy on multiple platforms.
  - It also provides built features such as player movement, camera movement, and collision detection, which are all essential for a top down 2D game.
  - Unity Asset Store provides a large library of assets that we can use to create our game. This includes sprites, animations, and sound effects and are easily imported into the game.

- Version Control: Plastic SCM
   - Plastic SCM is a version control system built into Unity. It allows us to easily track changes to our code and revert back to previous versions if needed.
   - A GUI application similar to Github Desktop is provided to allow us to easily view the changes made to our code.
   - Plastic SCM is used by many large companies such as Ubisoft, EA, and many other indie developers to manage their code and have provided examples of their workflows and best practices.
  
- Documentation Tool: Visual Studio Code
   - When choosing a documentation tool, we wanted to choose something that was simple to write markdown in and was easy to use.
   - The use of version control was also important as we wanted to be able to easily track changes to our documentation.

- Communication: Microsoft Teams
   - Microsoft Teams is a communication tool that allows us to easily communicate with each other and share files.
   - It also allows us to easily create meetings and share our screen to show each other our progress.
   - It is also easy to use and has a simple interface that allows us to easily navigate through the application.

- Project Management: TBA

  - Trello
  - JIRA



### 2.1.3 Technology Alternatives
- Game Engine Alternatives: Unreal Engine ,GameMaker Studio 2, Custom Engine
  - Unreal Engine
    - Although Unreal Engine is a great engine, it is not as beginner friendly as Unity. It also has a much higher learning curve and is more difficult to use. It also utilizes C++ instead of C#, which none of the team members have experience with.

  - GameMaker Studio 2
    - Another popular option for 2D games but for this project we wanted to use a more popular engine that would allow us to easily deploy on multiple platforms.
    - The asset store for GameMaker Studio 2 is not as large as Unityâ€™s and does not provide as many assets as Unity does.
    - Scripts are written in GML, which is a custom scripting language that is not as popular as C# and unfamiliar to the team members.
    - For testing Unity allows developers modify the game in real time, which is not possible in GameMaker Studio 2.

- Version Control Alternative: Git
  - Git is the most popular version control system However, it is not built into Unity and requires additional setup to use.
  - The major drawback of using Git is the way Unity handles its assets and how it tracks them into a project. For larger assets it's is recommended to use Git LFS so when uploaded to Github you won't run into file size limits.
