# What players cant / can do
 



- Can deliver packages during the day. I recommend a minimum “quota” each day, so that the player will always have something to steal the following night. It also enforces the idea that the player is a well-mannered delivery driver by day. Delivering packages drains Endurance/Energy, and they cannot deliver more packages than their endurance. 

- Can steal the packages that they delivered that day. If they are caught by the inhabitants of the house or any surveillance, the game ends. Stealing packages drains Endurance/Energy, and they cannot steal more packages if they run out of Endurance/Energy. It also increases the threat level of the player. 

- Can eat a meal before leaving to deliver/steal packages. Eating a meal offers a minor benefit for that shift. 

- Cannot commit any crimes other than theft (i.e. no assault & battery), and the only thing they can steal are packages, that were delivered that day. 

- Can acquire items from stolen packages. Packages can only be opened after the night shift, when they return to their apartment. 

- Can go to the shop. Here, the player can purchase items and skill tree upgrades. At night, after the night shift, the player can sell any items that they have, including items that they stole that night. 

- Can go to bed at the end of the day. This will reset Endurance/Energy to full, decrease the threat level. Otherwise, the game ends.
